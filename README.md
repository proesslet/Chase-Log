# Chase-Log
This is a simple webapp used to log all of my storm chases. It is still a work in progress, however in it's current state the new entry form does work and even inserts the data 
into a SQL database. Eventually I will add a way to view these entries from the webapp.

Future Features
-View Entries
-Sort Entries
-Edit Entries(?)
-More details for entries (number of tornadoes, max hail size, etc)
-Much more emphasis on design
-User accounts (to allow for multiple people to use this while keeping their entries separate)
-Perhaps a way to view statistics on number of tornados, succsessful chases, etc on graphs or something
